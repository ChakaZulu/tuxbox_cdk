Q: Why is there no configure script?
A: "autoconf" creates configure from "configure.ac". You can call
   "./autogen.sh", which will call "autoconf" for you.

Q: Why is there no "Makefile", neither in the root
   directory nor in any subdirectory?
A: "configure" creates "Makefile" from "Makefile.in". "./configure --help"
   usually shows the available options.

Q: Why is there no "Makefile.in"?
A: "automake" creates "Makefile.in" from "Makefile.am". You can call
   "./autogen.sh", which will call "automake" for you. If you call
   "automake" manually, then make sure your working directory contains
   "configure.ac".

Q: Why does nobody want to answer my question?
A: Because it has probably already been answered many times and is already
   documented. See "https://tuxbox.org/forum/". However, sometimes it
   happens that your question gets lost in the huge number of posts. Please
   feel free to ask your question again.

Q: What is a good place to look for more answers to
   my problems with linux on my dbox2?
A: The forum at "https://tuxbox.org/forum/" provides a search facility.
   Tuxbox-Wiki, "http://wiki.dbox2-tuning.net/Development"
   There are also public mailing lists at
   "https://developer.berlios.de/mail/?group_id=72".

Q: How can I move files to a different location in cvs without losing their
   history?
A: 1) If the destination directory does not exist, then create it using
      "cvs add <directory>". This makes sure that your new directory has
      correct permissions.
   2) On the cvs server's filesystem, copy the files you want to move to the
      new location.
   3) Use "cvs remove -f <filename>" to remove files from the old location.
   Do NOT move the files on the filesystem, just copy
   and "cvs remove -f". Deleting cvs revision files on
   the filesystem is a bad thing[tm].
   To rename files just skip step 1.
