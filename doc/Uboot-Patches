U-Boot: Changes for tuxbox
--------------------------

Quick and dirty description of the patches that are applied to the original U-Boot tree.
May they be a guide for someone trying to port to uboot 2.x or something.

/:
Makefile (patch)
	- add u-boot.stripped and u-boot.treeboot targets
	- add dbox2_config target
	- add the removal of mktree and its output to "make clean" and "make clobber"

/common:
cmd_flash.c (patch)
	- new option for command "flash" called "ld" (lockdown) added

cmd_fs.c (new)
	- new command

cmd_net.c (patch)
	- export function "netboot_update_env(void)"

cmd_nvedit.c (patch)
	- "saveenv"-function now only present if both commands "env" and "flash" are present AND
	  also CFG_ENV_IS_IN_NVRAM or CFG_ENV_IS_IN_EEPROM is defined.
	  Originally either of these was sufficient (AND was OR).

devices.c (patch)
	- add dbox2-init function

env_common.c (patch)
	- add CFG_DBOX2_ENV_READ_FS-option to get environment from flash

main.c (patch)
	- print messages on LCD
	- allow selection of up to 5 autoboot items from a list defined in the config

/cpu/mpc8xx
cpu_init.c (patch)
	- if we define CONFIG_SECONDSTAGE don't init memory controller (BMon does this for us)

start.S (patch)
	- if CONFIG_SECONDSTAGE is defined we have to manually skip the initial version-bytes

/fs/cramfs
cramfs.c (patch)
uncompress.c (patch)
/fs/jffs2
compr_rtime.c (patch)
compr_rubin.c (patch)
compr_zlib.c (patch)
jffs2_1pass.c (patch)
mini_inflate.c (patch)
	- only use these if dbox2-specific CONFIG_FS contains cramfs/jffs2

/include
cmd_confdefs.h (patch)
	- add defines for CONFIG_FS

cmd_fs.h (new)
	- header for dbox2-specific fs-command

commproc.h (patch)
	- add defines for ethernet

devices.h (patch)
	- add init routine

flash.h (patch)
	- add STM_ID_28W320CB and STM320CB

lcd.h (patch)
	- replace lcd_init (void *lcdbase) by lcd_init (void) if CONFIG_LCD_BOARD is defined

version.h (patch)
	- add "Tuxbox" comment to U_BOOT_VERSION

/include/jffs2
load_kernel.h
	- hide double defined struct if cmd_fs.h is used

/lib-generic
crc32.c (patch)
	- change complement behaviour for JFFS2-FS

/net
bootp.c (patch)
	- compensate bootmanager's inability to send the network root path
	- ignore Broadcast Address Option
	- debug_ext unhandled DHCP-Options instead of just printing them all the time
net.c (patch)
	- do netboot_update_env when we reached NETLOOP_SUCCESS (all network information received)
tftp.c (patch)
	- do not retry TFTP after an error

/tools
Makefile (patch)
	- build mktree
mktree.c (new)
	- tool to build a tree bootable image (for BMon)
