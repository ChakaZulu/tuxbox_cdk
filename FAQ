#  Frequently Asked Questions about the Cross Development Kit
#

Q: why is there no configure script?
A: autoconf creates configure from configure.ac

Q: why is there no Makefile, neither in the root
   directory nor in any subdirectory?
A: configure creates Makefile from Makefile.in

Q: why is there no Makefile.in?
A: automake creates Makefile.in from Makefile.am

Q: why does nobody want to answer my question?
A: because it has probably already been answered
   many times and is already documented

Q: what is a good place to look for more answers to
   my problems with linux and d-box 2?
A: the forum at http://tuxbox.berlios.de/forum/
   provides a very good search facility

Q: How can I move files to a different location in
   cvs without losing their history?
A: 1) If the destination directory does not exist,
      then create it using "cvs add". This makes sure
      that your new directory has correct permissions.
   2) On the cvs server's filesystem, copy the files
      you want to move to the new location.
   3) Use "cvs remove" to remove files from the old
      location.
   Do NOT move the files on the filesystem, just copy
   and "cvs remove". Deleting cvs revision files on
   the filesystem is a bad thing[tm].
   To rename files just skip step 1.
